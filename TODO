o Recover from random errors in the plugin and at least don't kill the loop
o Check if a image file is actually present before trying to render it so we don't cache the ENOENT
o Show loading images where we have a download in progress
* Compute area needed to cover so we can request the correct range; support range requests
o Pre-load the screen images for all fetched (and over-fetched) works so they are ready to show
o Put an LRU cache in place in front of egui's image cache so we can keep memory under control
o Add support for rate limiting
* Fetch images in parallel
* Show number of works next to each tag
* Support negative tags
