* Download all things to a (genuinly random) tmp path and rename
* Check if a image file is actually present before trying to render it so we don't cache the ENOENT
* Compute area needed to cover so we can request the correct range; support range requests
* Pre-load the screen images for all fetched (and over-fetched) works so they are ready to show
* Put an LRU cache in place in front of egui's image cache so we can keep memory under control
* Add support for rate limiting
* Fetch images in parallel
* Support negative tags
