Take control of your digital media. Download, browse, and experience the artwork you care about locally and privately,
without the fear that a critical service will disappear and take your cherished memories with it.

Artchiver comes bundled with plugins to access the world's largest galleries of public domain art, a podcast listener,
and a feed reader. With plugins, you can extend it to support anything with an API.

## Getting started

Download a binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/Trained-Monkey-Studio/artchiver/releases)
and run it.
