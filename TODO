o Recover from random errors in the plugin and at least don't kill the loop
o Check if a image file is actually present before trying to render it so we don't cache the ENOENT
o Show loading images where we have a download in progress
o Pre-load the screen images for all fetched (and over-fetched) works so they are ready to show
o Put an LRU cache in place in front of egui's image cache so we can keep memory under control
o Add support for rate limiting
o Fetch images in parallel
o Show number of works next to each tag
o Print response errors better; ~Re-create the Agent if we ever crash out to the top-level~ Fix Met rate limits
o Insert work-tag links for all tags a work has, not just the one we're querying on
o Make positive tags an ^ rather than a v.
o Allow selecting an image and show its metadata
o Limit number of images we try to upload each frame to avoid freezing the UI
o Compute area needed to cover so we can request the correct range; support range requests
o Port to eframe
o Center works in their viewports and figure out how to kill spacing between works
o Associate refresh tags with the plugin rather than a global
o Cache works lookups
o Zoom mode to show full size image
o Keys to browse a gallery
o Center the slideshow image
